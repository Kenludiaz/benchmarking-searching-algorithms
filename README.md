This is a C++ application which implements Sparse Matrices
using **Doubly Linked Lists**. This program is more memory
efficient than it's vector counterpart.

## Contributions
___
This program was made possible by myself ([Kenludiaz](https://github.com/Kenludiaz)) and [jbinwu39](https://github.com/jbinwu39). 
Much of it was done through pair programming. However,
the **addition** function was primarily designed by myself and
the **multiplication** function was primarily designed by [jbinwu39](https://github.com/jbinwu39).
